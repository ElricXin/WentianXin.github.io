## A cycling enthusiast

I have been enthusiastic about bicycling since middle school. In summer 2019 I bought an aerobike *Giant 2018 PROPEL ADV PRO 2*, trained a lot and made my first ITT (individual time trial) good record of covering 8.77 km with an average speed of 41.29 km/h by the Taihu Lake (China's 3rd largest freshwater lake), Wuxi on Sept. 14, 2019. After one year, a better ITT record of covering 8.77 km with an average speed of 42.44 km/h on May. 31, 2020.

When I entered USTC in 2019, I joined the university cycling club and planned to attend a lot of cycling races and activities, with ambition and optimism. However, the Covid-19 pandemic which started in December 2019 just put the mockers on my plan, with almost all races cancelled and regular riding paused.

After one and a half year, one of my best cycling record came in April 2021, when the 1st Online National University Cycling Race was held. In the *men's one-kilometer time trial*, I finished in 1 min 24 seconds at an average power-weight ratio of 501watt/65kg and ranked 8-th. Since this race did not discriminate bewteen amateurs and professionals (in fact 5 of 7 players with rank higher than me are professionals), I am quite satisfied with this result. In the *3-kilometer team relay*, out team also ranked 8-th.

Here are some pictures.
