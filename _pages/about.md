Short Bio
===

I am **Yue WU (吴越)**, a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [School of the Gifted Young](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majoring in Information & Computational Science (2019 fall --- 2022 summer GPA: 3.98/4.3, rank: 1st in the major). I grew up in Wuxi, Jiangsu in eastern China. 

My primary research interest is the analysis, development and implementation of high-order numerical methods for PDEs, especially the discontinuous Galerkin methods and the finite element methods. See my programming experience [here](/research_red/).
