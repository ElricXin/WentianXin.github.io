Short Bio
===
My name is **Yue Wu (吴越)**, and I am a senior student at [School of the Gifted Young](http://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/) (SGY), [University of Science and Technology of China](http://en.ustc.edu.cn/) (USTC), majoring in Computational Mathematics. I grew up in Wuxi, Jiangsu in Eastern China.

My primary research interests is analysis, development and implementation of high-order numerical algorithms for PDEs, such as finite difference/volumn WENO, discontinuous Galerkin and spectral methods, with application in real-world and industrial problems, including CFD and nuclear fusion simulation.
